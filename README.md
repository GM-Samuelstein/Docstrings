<h2 id="01">Why Documenting Your Code Is So Important.</h2>

<p>Hopefully, if you&rsquo;re reading this tutorial, you already know the importance of documenting your code. But if not, then let me quote something Guido mentioned to me at a recent <a href="https://realpython.com/pycon-guide/">PyCon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Code is more often read than written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash; <em>Guido van Rossum</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you write code, you write it for two primary audiences: your users and your developers (including yourself). Both audiences are equally important. If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;ve probably opened up old codebases and wondered to yourself, &ldquo;What in the world was I thinking?&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re having a problem reading your own code, imagine what your users or other developers are experiencing when they&rsquo;re trying to use or contribute to your code.</p>
<p>Conversely, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve run into a situation where you wanted to do something in Python and found what looks like a great library that can get the job done. However, when you start using the library, you look for examples, write-ups, or even official documentation on how to do something specific and can&rsquo;t immediately find the solution.</p>
<p>After searching, you come to realize that the documentation is lacking or even worse, missing entirely. This is a frustrating feeling that deters you from using the library, no matter how great or efficient the code is. Daniele Procida summarized this situation best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how good your software is, because <strong>if the documentation is not good enough, people will not use it.</strong>&ldquo;</p>
<p>&mdash; <em><a href="https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/">Daniele Procida</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this guide, you&rsquo;ll learn from the ground up how to properly document your Python code from the smallest of scripts to the largest of <a href="https://realpython.com/intermediate-python-project-ideas/">Python projects</a> to help prevent your users from ever feeling too frustrated to use or contribute to your project.</p>
